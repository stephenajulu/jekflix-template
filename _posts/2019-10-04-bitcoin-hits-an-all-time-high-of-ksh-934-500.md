Bitcoin (BTC), the most popular digital asset in the market, for the first time in 2019 reached a new high of above ksh.934,500 ($8900) on Sunday before retracting slightly, according to CoinDesk’s price data. The last time Bitcoin peaked that high was in May 2018.



“Goodbye meme triangle, hello $10k+ targets. Some people were screaming triple top when the more obvious conclusion is retest after retest of resistance will finally lead to a break to the upside. Bitcoin could cool off, run sideways but IMO will continue to move up over $10k,” said Crypto trader Josh Rager who is expecting more gains with BTC pushing past $10k.



At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at ksh.917,412.3 ($8,737.26). Meanwhile, other highly ranked cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), XRP and Bitcoin Cash were trading at ksh.26,767 ($267.67), ksh. 11,952.15 ($113.83), ksh. 44.247 ($0.4214) and ksh.45,450.3 ($432.86) respectively.

If the value of Bitcoin continues to see an upward trend in the coming days, it could very soon breach the ksh. 1,000,000 ($10,000) mark.
